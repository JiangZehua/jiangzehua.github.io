Hi! I'm Zehua Jiang!

I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at New York University. Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU and a Bachelor's degree from the School of Physics at <a href='https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/'>Sun Yat-sen University</a>. I am a researcher, programmer, traveler, photographer, and video editor. 

My research journey at the <a href='https://game.engineering.nyu.edu/'>NYU Game Innovation Lab</a> with Prof. <a href='http://julian.togelius.com/'>Julian Togelius</a> has been marked by contributions to a range of stimulating projects. My work primarily focuses on procedural content generation (PCG) in games and generating synthetic biometric information (including iris and fingerprint data). 

My contact information is listed in the icons below, feel free to contact me anytime!

My name is typically pronounced as "Ze-hua Jiang" in English. Here's a rough breakdown of the pronunciation:
- "Ze" is pronounced like "_zuh_" with a soft "z" sound and a slight "uh" sound at the end.
- "hua" is pronounced like "_hwa_", with a soft "h" sound and a slight "w" sound at the beginning.
- "Jiang" is pronounced like "_jahng_", with a soft "j" sound at the beginning and a nasal "ng" sound at the end.
